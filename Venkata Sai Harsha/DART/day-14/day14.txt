Getters and Setters:
Getter → Used to get (read) the value of a private property.
Setter → Used to set (update) the value of a private property.
In Dart, we often make fields private (using _) and control access with getters and setters.

we can write get methods in two ways in dart one is generall way and another is using lambda function which is higher order function 


class Student {
  String? _name;  // private variable
  int? _age;

  // Setter for name
  set name(String name) {
    this._name = name;
  }

  // Getter for name
  /*String? get name {
    return _name;
  }*/
  
  String? getname(){
	return name;
  }

  // Setter for age
  set age(int age) {
    if (age > 0) {
      this._age = age;
    } else {
      print("Age must be positive");
    }
  }

  // Getter for age
  int? get age => _age; // short-hand getter
}

void main() {
  var s = Student();

  s.name = "Sai";   // calls setter
  s.age = 21;       // calls setter

  print("Name: ${s.name}"); // calls getter
  print("Age: ${s.age}");   // calls getter
}



In Dart, any identifier (variable, method, class, function) that starts with _ is private.
BUT: “private” in Dart means it is restricted to the same library, not just to the same class.

Key idea:
A library in Dart = a Dart file (or multiple files imported together using part of / part).
So, if two classes are in the same library (file), they can access each other’s private members (those starting with _).
Here in dart library means the same file and different files and different libraries 

Same file (same library):
// file: student.dart
class Student {
  String _name;   // private
  int _age;

  Student(this._name, this._age);
}

class Teacher {
  void showStudentInfo(Student s) {
    // ✅ Can access private variables (same file = same library)
    print("Student name: ${s._name}");
    print("Student age: ${s._age}");
  }
}

void main() {
  var s = Student("Sai", 21);
  var t = Teacher();
  t.showStudentInfo(s);
}


Different files (different libraries):

// student.dart
class Student {
  String _name;
  int _age;
  Student(this._name, this._age);
}

// teacher.dart
import 'student.dart';

class Teacher {
  void showStudentInfo(Student s) {
    // ❌ ERROR: Can't access private variables
    // print(s._name);
    // print(s._age);
  }
}
