1. var in Dart

When you use var, Dart infers the type at compile time based on the first assigned value.

Once assigned, the type is fixed and cannot be changed later.

 Example:
void main() {
  var x = 9;
  print(x);                // Output: 9
  print(x.runtimeType);    // Output: int

  x = 111;                 // OK: still int
  print(x);                // Output: 111
  print(x.runtimeType);    // Output: int
}

 Reassigning with a different type:
void main() {
  var x = 9;
  print(x);
  print(x.runtimeType);

  x = 111.89868;           //  Error: double assigned to var of type int
  print(x);
  print(x.runtimeType);
}


Note: var is statically typed — Dart remembers the type from the first assignment.

2. dynamic in Dart

The dynamic keyword tells Dart: "don't check the type at compile time — figure it out at runtime."

A dynamic variable can hold values of different types across its lifetime.

 Example:
void main() {
  dynamic x = 9;
  print(x);                // Output: 9
  print(x.runtimeType);    // Output: int

  x = 111.89868;           // OK: now a double
  print(x);                // Output: 111.89868
  print(x.runtimeType);    // Output: double
}


Note: Use dynamic only when needed — it disables type checking, so it's more flexible but also less safe.

3. Boolean (bool) in Dart

Dart uses the bool type for boolean logic.

Values are either true or false.

 Example:
void main() {
  bool isAlive = true;

  if (isAlive) {
    print("YES");   // Output: YES
  } else {
    print("No");
  }
}

4. Floating-point numbers in Dart

Dart does not use float — it uses double for all decimal numbers.

num is a supertype of both int and double.

 Example using num:
void main() {
  num y = 0.1;
  num x = 0.2;

  print(x + y);    // Output: 0.30000000000000004
}


Note: This is a floating-point precision issue (common in many languages). It's not specific to num — it would also happen with double.

5. int

Used for whole numbers.

Cannot hold decimal values.

int x = 10;
x = 3.14;       //  Error

6. double

Used for decimal numbers (floating-point).

double x = 3.14;
x = 10;         // OK (10 is converted to 10.0)

7. String

Used for text values.

Supports interpolation and many methods.

String name = 'Alice';
print('Hello $name');     // Hello Alice
